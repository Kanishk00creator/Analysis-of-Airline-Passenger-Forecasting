# Analysis-of-Airline-Passenger-Forecasting
This notebook demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a time-series forecasting model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. The goal is to predict the number of airline passengers for the upcoming months based on historical data from the previous 24 months.
